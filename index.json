[{"content":"TL;DR If you want to have a good read, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend skipping the TL;DR segment. You might miss some fun when reading the article if you read this out. You\u0026rsquo;ve been warned.\n/dev/stdin, /dev/stdout, and /stderr are not required to be implemented by the POSIX standard, but are listed as POSIX extensions. Similarly, /proc (or the procfs) is also just listed as an extension just once in the POSIX standard, with no mention of what things need to be there inside.\nIf you read it fully, you might find a interesting thing or two which you might get surprised to figure out even if you are using a Unix-like system since years.\nNote\nFrom Wikipedia\u0026rsquo;s POSIX page section \u0026ldquo;Versions after 1997\u0026rdquo;\nAfter 1997, the Austin Group developed the POSIX revisions. The specifications are known under the name Single UNIX Specification, before they become a POSIX standard when formally approved by the ISO.\nFrom Wikipedia\u0026rsquo;s UNIX page The Single UNIX Specification (SUS) is a standard for computer operating systems, compliance with which is required to qualify for using the \u0026ldquo;UNIX\u0026rdquo; trademark.\nSo every UNIX system can also be referred as a POSIX system.\nIntroduction If you have use Linux, or any other *NIX like system, or even just wrote bash scripts to automate your silly tasks in the terminal, you might be knowing of the following special files:\n/dev/stdin /dev/stdout /dev/stderr /dev/null /dev/random /dev/sd{a,b,...} /proc/* If not all, you might be atleast knowing a few of them (if not others atleast /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout or /dev/stderr). Now I am not going to the depths of *NIX and try to explain in detail about each and every of these files, because I believe there are better articles on the web that do their job pretty well.\nThis article is going to be about portability and how a lot of the Unix-like systems which are popular today differ from the POSIX standards\nFile Descriptors on POSIX systems File Descriptors (or FDs in short) are just integer identifiers for open files for a process. There are 3 special FDs:\n0: for stdin 1: for stdout 2: for stderr Now if you are a seasoned Bash scripting guy (or even a seasonal one), you might have done something like this to pass the output of previous command to an executable that does not support reading from the stdin, but only supports reading from a file:\n1 2 3 # prev_command | ./another_executable # Above commented command doesn\u0026#39;t work as another_executable isn\u0026#39;t designed to read from stdin prev_command | ./another_executable /dev/stdin This just tricks the another_executable to read from stdout even though the executable doesn\u0026rsquo;t support it. This is because on a lot of UNIX-like Systems (but not all UNIX-like systems, and we\u0026rsquo;ll be coming to that point later), /dev/stdin is a special block device that just contains the contents of the standard input.\nSimilarly, the following hack is also used at times when the command only supports writing to a file, but you want the output in stdout:\n1 ./command /dev/stdout This works, just like the above command. UNIX philosophy of everything is a file is indeed really wonderful.\nYou might have used /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout and /dev/stderr on a multitude of systems including Linux, FreeBSD, etc.\n/dev and /proc virtual filesystem If you are using a Unix-like system since some time, you must be knowing that /dev, /proc and /sys are some special directories containing virtual devices/other virtual files that contain system information like uptime information, kernel version, cpu information, etc. You might even have read from them for your own bash scripts at times.\nSurprise 1: /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout and /dev/stderr may not exist on a POSIX compliant system This started with me running the Node.js test suite on my old Android device running Android 7.0. Some of the tests that failed on it were tests trying to read the /dev/stdin file instead of just simply trying to read the file via process.stdin. There are tests for process.stdin separately as well, but some were hardcoded to simply read /dev/stdin on Unix-like systems. One of the tests had something like (test/parallel/test-fs-readfile-pipe-large.js):\n1 2 3 4 5 6 ... fs.readFile(\u0026#39;/dev/stdin\u0026#39;, function(er, data) { assert.ifError(er); process.stdout.write(data); }); ... Then I was like, huh! Why is this failing with an error indicating that the file /dev/stdin does not exist? I just did a quick file /dev/stdin and found that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist. Nor did /dev/stdout and /dev/stderr exist. I just used to assume that they do exist on all devices! Then I looked on the internet to find the workaround, and StackOverflow gave me a workaround: to use /proc/self/fd/{fd} where fd is 0, 1 or 2. And it worked.\nThen I fixed the tests and kept the patches with me for around 3 years and forgot about it. And now that I decided to upstream some of the Android build fixes for Node.js which I was keeping with me for a long time so that others may benefit too. I sent the PR and waited for CI to turn green, but it failed. And it turns out that MacOS doesn\u0026rsquo;t have procfs (/proc), but exposes most of those stuff via sysctl as documented over https://web.archive.org/web/20200103161748/http://osxbook.com/book/bonus/ancient/procfs/.\nThen I looked over on my Arch Linux system:\n1 2 3 4 $ file /dev/std* /dev/stderr: symbolic link to /proc/self/fd/2 /dev/stdin: symbolic link to /proc/self/fd/0 /dev/stdout: symbolic link to /proc/self/fd/1 Huh! and they exist on my Arch box. with symlinks to /proc/self/fd/0, /proc/self/fd/1 and /proc/self/fd/2\nThis time, I checked whether the patch was actually needed right now. Maybe Android now as /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout and /dev/stderr. Then I once again looked on my newer Android device:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # Can\u0026#39;t use glob /dev/std* without root on Termux (works with ADB though) ~ $ file /dev/stdin /dev/stdin: symbolic link to /proc/self/fd/0 ~ $ file /dev/stdout /dev/stdout: symbolic link to /proc/self/fd/1 ~ $ file /dev/stderr /dev/stderr: symbolic link to /proc/self/fd/2 Perhaps /dev/std* didn\u0026rsquo;t exist on the older Android device as it had a really older kernel version. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the older device with me, so I tried running a Android VM with Android 8.1 and it didn\u0026rsquo;t have /dev/std* as well, so definitely it was a Android using older version of the Linux kernel.\nSo, Linux just has /dev/std* as symlinks to /proc/self/fd/*. But those don\u0026rsquo;t exist on MacOS. Why is MacOS acting weird and not just following the standard. And FreeBSD too didn\u0026rsquo;t have /proc virtual filesystem. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find any information about why this is the case, so I decided to take matters into my own hands and try to read the POSIX manual and figure out if /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout /dev/stderr, and /proc/* are even part of the specification. And they aren\u0026rsquo;t! Yes, you read that right, /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout and /dev/stderr are mentioned exactly once together and are mentioned as optional non-standard extensions.\nBoth /dev/stdin and /dev/stderr are just mentioned exactly once in the entire POSIX.1-2024 document (the latest as of writing this blog) which defines the standards for any system to be POSIX complaint.\nThe system may provide non-standard extensions. These are features not required by POSIX.1-2024 and may include, but are not limited to: \u0026hellip; Additional character special files with special properties (for example, /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout, and /dev/stderr) 2.1.1 Requirements, Page 15\nBut funnily enough there are a total of 14 mentions of /dev/stdout in the document as possible files passed to various POSIX command line utilities. Some of them mentions that passing - or /dev/stdout to the output file would result in the output being written to the stdout. So perhaps, even though the /dev/stdout is an optional non-standard extension, it\u0026rsquo;s popular enough that the authors decided to mention it in the document.\nSurprise 2: /proc itself may not exist on a POSIX compliant system The POSIX standards do not even specify anything about /proc, even the procfs is mentioned only once in the entire document as a non-standard extension. (See Page 15 of the document 2.1.1 Requirements).\nFreeBSD doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have procfs enabled by default and you need to mount it yourself. And it\u0026rsquo;s deprecated\nSurprise 3: /dev/random is also not part of the POSIX specification You might have just read from /dev/random multiple times in bash scripts when trying to gather some entropy or random data. But the POSIX has no mention it in it\u0026rsquo;s entire specification! In fact the POSIX specification only mentions about /dev/null, /dev/tty and /dev/console. Yes, that\u0026rsquo;s the entire thing documented under chapter 10 titled \u0026ldquo;Directory Structure and Devices\u0026rdquo;.\nConclusion There /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout or /dev/stderr which is guaranteed to work on all POSIX systems. It is very important to note this when writing portable software. Although all these files exist on almost all POSIX system I have used (if you add the old Android phone I mentioned of earlier), it\u0026rsquo;s not guaranteed to work. The only portable way is to actually just use the file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 for /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout and /dev/stderr respectively. And there exists no portable way to specify a program to write to stdout/stderr instead of a file unless the program supports doing it.\nAlthough a lot of the special files which we are used to in the /dev and /proc are missing from the POSIX standard, I must say that almost all of the C APIs are really well thought and documented really well. The structs for all the data types like addrinfo are really well thought of. The C API documentation also is very extensive. This proves that even after 50+ years of existing, Unix\u0026rsquo;s design was just really good and well thought that still today we have majority of webservers, and almost all of the supercomputers in the world running either Linux or other Unix-like OS like BSDs. I just find it wild how well thought the entire Unix OS was at that time!\nAlso at times, it\u0026rsquo;s better to read the documentation/manual/specification instead of relying on internet articles to solve your problems if you don\u0026rsquo;t want headaches in future.\nCorrections This article may not be completely accurate, although I have tried to ensure that it is.

I guess the idea is that people who solved the most of the problems with the best approach would be selected in the club. There were different tasks for different team. Since I wanted to join the DSA Team (also called SigSTP team), I did these problems.\nProblems For people outside of NITP reading this blog, if you want to see the problems you can view a copy of the problem statements on the GitHub repository linked above:\nTask 1: ATM Machine Problem Statement Task 2: Task Manager Problem Statement Task 3: Trial of the Cheater\u0026rsquo;s Path Problem Statement In this blog, I\u0026rsquo;ll only be discussing about Task 3 as Task 1 and Task 2 are quite easy and standard problems.\nTask 1 Task 1 was a classical ATM vending machine problem or a coin change problem. It was just a matter of modulo and repeat, and check if we were able to dispense the money or not.\nYou can find my solution for the Task 1 here\nTask 2 Task 2 was a task manager implementation which was just a matter of using priority_queue. Since I choose to do the problems with C++, I could simply make use of std::priority_queue, but I decided not to as the problem also required me to print the queue when requested. It is not possible to get the internal queue in std::priority_queue, other implementations like that of the Boost library do allow this, but what\u0026rsquo;s the point of using a library when you can do it yourself and learn along.\nI ended up using std::vector to store the tasks which were sorted using std::less\u0026lt;\u0026gt;. This way I could insert tasks into the data structure with O(log n) time complexity and retrieve the top task with O(1) time complexity. And for getting the queue, I simply returned the internal std::vector which was already sorted.\nYou can find my solution for the Task 2 here\nTask-2/TaskManager.cc and Task-2/TaskManager.h contains the implementation for the queue/actual task manager.\nTask 3 Task 3 was a medium difficulty task, and the only one I found interesting enough. The puzzle wanted us to solve a maze such that each point had two options to navigate to, left (L) and right (R). The puzzle contained two pieces of information in the form of text files:\nInstructions: The directions to take each time. These directions are supposed to be repeated LLLRRRLRRLL.....\nThese instructions could simply be parsed with a switch statement and going over the file character by character.\nTask-3/parser.cc:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 auto parseInstruction(std::istream \u0026amp;inp) -\u0026gt; Instructions { Instructions directions = {}; for (char ch = inp.get(); !inp.eof(); ch = inp.get()) { switch (ch) { case \u0026#39;L\u0026#39;: directions.emplace_back(Instruction::Left); break; case \u0026#39;R\u0026#39;: directions.emplace_back(Instruction::Right); break; default: throw std::runtime_error(\u0026#34;Invalid character encountered in instruction file\u0026#34;); } } return directions; } Here Instruction is simply an enum class with two members Instruction::Left and Instruction::Right which are the two directions which can be specified in the instrutions.\nThe map: The other part was information about where the left and right directions take you from a particular position:\n1 2 3 4 PGQ = (QRB, MJB) JQC = (MNM, TLQ) HNP = (NKD, PJT) ... Noticing the pattern, we can store this as a std::map from std::string to struct { std::string Left, Right; }. Further to speed comparisions in future, we can convert 3-character strings to a number. Since 3-character strings containing letters A-Z have around 26*26*26 possibilities, which can fit into an int16_t.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 auto parseNode(std::string str) -\u0026gt; Node { Node node = 0; for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; 3; i++) { node *= 26; node += (str[i] - \u0026#39;A\u0026#39;); } return node; } Similarly parseNode() can also be declared for a std::ifstream\nNow that we can parse nodes, we need to make sure that the file is parsing things correctly and holding proper syntax:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 auto parsePuzzle(std::istream \u0026amp;inp) -\u0026gt; Puzzle { Puzzle nodes; // This is intentionally an int instead of a char, as inp.get() will return an EOF which is supposed to be greater // than 255. int chr; while (true) { Node const node = parseNode(inp); Node left; Node right; chr = inp.get(); MAKESURE_ELSE_ERROR_PARSING(chr == \u0026#39; \u0026#39;); chr = inp.get(); MAKESURE_ELSE_ERROR_PARSING(chr == \u0026#39;=\u0026#39;); ... chr = inp.get(); NodeData const nodeData = { .left = left, .right = right, }; nodes.emplace(node, nodeData); if (inp.eof()) { break; } MAKESURE_ELSE_ERROR_PARSING(chr == \u0026#39;\\n\u0026#39;); } return nodes; } Here, MAKESURE_ELSE_ERROR_PARSING is just a helper macro that throws an exception if the file doesn\u0026rsquo;t match the expected format. Also Puzzle is just a typedef to std::unordered_map\u0026lt;Node, NodeData\u0026gt;. I used std::unordered_map instead of std::map as in unordered map, lookups have a time complexity of O(n)\nPart 1 We have to reach ZZZ starting from AAA. We can do this by simply following the instructions and counting the number of steps taken. steps % instructions.size() will give the number of instruction which we have to follow for that step. Then we can simply update the current node to the left or right node and repeat the process.\nFrom Task-3/partOne.cc\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 uint64_t steps = 0; for (Node currentNode = parseNode(\u0026#34;AAA\u0026#34;); currentNode != parseNode(\u0026#34;ZZZ\u0026#34;); steps++) { switch (instructions[steps % instructions.size()]) { case Instruction::Left: currentNode = puzzle.at(currentNode).left; break; case Instruction::Right: currentNode = puzzle.at(currentNode).right; break; } } Part 2 We have to start from every node starting with the letter A and reach node starting with letter Z at the same time from all starting position. This is a simple LCM problem, we simply find the minimum steps from each such node and then find the LCM of all these steps.\nFrom Task-3/partTwo.cc\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 // First find all the currentNodes that start with the letter \u0026#39;A\u0026#39; for (size_t i = 0; i != currentNodes.size(); i++) { auto node = currentNodes[i]; // This is similar to partOne(), we are just finding the step where the node ends with a \u0026#34;Z\u0026#34; for (; node % 26 != 25; steps[i]++) { switch (instructions[steps[i] % instructions.size()]) { case Instruction::Left: node = puzzle.at(node).left; break; case Instruction::Right: node = puzzle.at(node).right; break; } } ... // Return lcm of steps Building my solutions from source I have provided a CMakeLists.txt file in the root of the git repository.

I love reading about what amazing things other people are doing, about how they are pushing the limits of what is possible, and how they solve their problems. As an aspiring engineer, I feel fascinated by technical writeups. Whenever I come across new blogs which I find interesting they often end up in my bookmarks. I have a few criteria which I use to decide if your site is worth bookmarking and revisiting.\nThe Criteria 1. Content Write something interesting, could be anything but share the technical details and don\u0026rsquo;t just write a PR nonsense. If I find too much PR nonsense on the site, it is very likely to be thrown away no matter how good the rest of the content is!\nAlso I like reading about emerging technologies, but if you are riding the hype train, I am not interested. I want to read about the real problems you faced and how you solved them, not about how you are using the latest and greatest tech which nobody else is. Show me how you built it, not how you\u0026rsquo;re using it.\n2. RSS Feed If you want me to come back to your site, have an RSS feed. I am not going to open up your site to find if there is something you. I let my RSS client take care of stuff I have read and left unread. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have an RSS feed, I am very likely not coming to your site unless it makes it to the top of Hacker News or any of the subreddits I follow (again using RSS). Also RSS feeds in my experience has also helped me filter out SEO crap, most sites that do have RSS feeds are either having it since a long time and are not just trying to game the SEO, or from hackers who love the simplicity of RSS. Your RSS doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be complete, just the title and description is enough and I will open your blogs/writeups if I find them interesting enough.\n3. JavaScript, no thanks! I use NoScript Your site should be completely usable without JavaScript. No site content should be unavailable without JavaScript. I use NoScript and I am not going to enable JavaScript just to read your blog. If your site is not usable without JavaScript, I am not coming back in any way. I use NoScript as a security measure, and I am no way going to disable it anyway. If you are using third-party analytics service like Google Analytics or any other, your site is definitely going to be ranked down by me, but I may still visit it if the content is good enough.\n4. No Twitter/any other walled garden links I don\u0026rsquo;t want to visit sites like Twitter which are basically a walled garden now. If you discuss a lot about sites which don\u0026rsquo;t allow me to view content without me providing my personal details like email and phone number, then I will not be coming back to your site. I absolutely hate sites which don\u0026rsquo;t allow viewing their content anonymously and without loading a ton of JavaScript. If you are discussing about a tweet, please add a screenshot of it in your writeup as Nitter is dead now. (RIP Nitter)\n5. No Captcha just to read your mostly static site Your site should be completely usable without any captchas. I am totally find to use them to limit spam for comments, but having to solve a captcha just to read your site is a big no for me. Captchas are really inaccessible and a lot of people with special needs can\u0026rsquo;t solve them. This is the exact reason why I stopped reading phoronix.com, it requires me to solve a captcha. Although the site then loads without JavaScript, it sets a cookie in my browser which I am not comfortable with.\nThanks for reading my blog.

I looked for all sorts of URLs encoded in the JS, and finally got the websocket which gave the URLs of the streams and also the relay streams along with the list of songs in playlist:\n1 2 3 }(t.PureComponent), Oa = new (St())( \u0026#34;wss://coderadio-admin.freecodecamp.org/api/live/nowplaying/coderadio\u0026#34;), Now I just had to somehow try to conmect to the websocket.
