You might miss some fun when reading the article if you read this out. You’ve been warned.\n/dev/stdin, /dev/stdout, and /stderr are not required to be implemented by the POSIX standard, but are listed as POSIX extensions. Similarly, /proc (or the procfs) is also just listed as an extension just once in the POSIX standard, with no mention of what things need to be there inside.\nIf you read it fully, you might find a interesting thing or two which you might get surprised to figure out even if you are using a Unix-like system since years.\nNote\nFrom Wikipedia’s POSIX page section “Versions after 1997”\nAfter 1997, the Austin Group developed the POSIX revisions. The specifications are known under the name Single UNIX Specification, before they become a POSIX standard when formally approved by the ISO.\nFrom Wikipedia’s UNIX page The Single UNIX Specification (SUS) is a standard for computer operating systems, compliance with which is required to qualify for using the “UNIX” trademark.\nSo every UNIX system can also be referred as a POSIX system.\nIntroduction If you have use Linux, or any other *NIX like system, or even just wrote bash scripts to automate your silly tasks in the terminal, you might be knowing of the following special files:\n/dev/stdin /dev/stdout /dev/stderr /dev/null /dev/random /dev/sd{a,b,...} /proc/* If not all, you might be atleast knowing a few of them (if not others atleast /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout or /dev/stderr). Now I am not going to the depths of *NIX and try to explain in detail about each and every of these files, because I believe there are better articles on the web that do their job pretty well.\nThis article is going to be about portability and how a lot of the Unix-like systems which are popular today differ from the POSIX standards\nFile Descriptors on POSIX systems File Descriptors (or FDs in short) are just integer identifiers for open files for a process. There are 3 special FDs:\n0: for stdin 1: for stdout 2: for stderr Now if you are a seasoned Bash scripting guy (or even a seasonal one), you might have done something like this to pass the output of previous command to an executable that does not support reading from the stdin, but only supports reading from a file:\n1 2 3 # prev_command | ./another_executable # Above commented command doesn't work as another_executable isn't designed to read from stdin prev_command | ./another_executable /dev/stdin This just tricks the another_executable to read from stdout even though the executable doesn’t support it. This is because on a lot of UNIX-like Systems (but not all UNIX-like systems, and we’ll be coming to that point later), /dev/stdin is a special block device that just contains the contents of the standard input.\nSimilarly, the following hack is also used at times when the command only supports writing to a file, but you want the output in stdout:\n1 ./command /dev/stdout This works, just like the above command. UNIX philosophy of everything is a file is indeed really wonderful.\nYou might have used /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout and /dev/stderr on a multitude of systems including Linux, FreeBSD, etc.\n/dev and /proc virtual filesystem If you are using a Unix-like system since some time, you must be knowing that /dev, /proc and /sys are some special directories containing virtual devices/other virtual files that contain system information like uptime information, kernel version, cpu information, etc. You might even have read from them for your own bash scripts at times.\nSurprise 1: /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout and /dev/stderr may not exist on a POSIX compliant system This started with me running the Node.js test suite on my old Android device running Android 7.0. Some of the tests that failed on it were tests trying to read the /dev/stdin file instead of just simply trying to read the file via process.stdin. There are tests for process.stdin separately as well, but some were hardcoded to simply read /dev/stdin on Unix-like systems. One of the tests had something like (test/parallel/test-fs-readfile-pipe-large.js):\n1 2 3 4 5 6 ... fs.readFile('/dev/stdin', function(er, data) { assert.ifError(er); process.stdout.write(data); }); ... Then I was like, huh! Why is this failing with an error indicating that the file /dev/stdin does not exist? I just did a quick file /dev/stdin and found that it doesn’t exist. Nor did /dev/stdout and /dev/stderr exist. I just used to assume that they do exist on all devices! Then I looked on the internet to find the workaround, and StackOverflow gave me a workaround: to use /proc/self/fd/{fd} where fd is 0, 1 or 2. And it worked.\nThen I fixed the tests and kept the patches with me for around 3 years and forgot about it. And now that I decided to upstream some of the Android build fixes for Node.js which I was keeping with me for a long time so that others may benefit too. I sent the PR and waited for CI to turn green, but it failed. And it turns out that MacOS doesn’t have procfs (/proc), but exposes most of those stuff via sysctl as documented over https://web.archive.org/web/20200103161748/http://osxbook.com/book/bonus/ancient/procfs/.\nThen I looked over on my Arch Linux system:\n1 2 3 4 $ file /dev/std* /dev/stderr: symbolic link to /proc/self/fd/2 /dev/stdin: symbolic link to /proc/self/fd/0 /dev/stdout: symbolic link to /proc/self/fd/1 Huh! and they exist on my Arch box. with symlinks to /proc/self/fd/0, /proc/self/fd/1 and /proc/self/fd/2\nThis time, I checked whether the patch was actually needed right now. Maybe Android now as /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout and /dev/stderr. Then I once again looked on my newer Android device:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # Can't use glob /dev/std* without root on Termux (works with ADB though) ~ $ file /dev/stdin /dev/stdin: symbolic link to /proc/self/fd/0 ~ $ file /dev/stdout /dev/stdout: symbolic link to /proc/self/fd/1 ~ $ file /dev/stderr /dev/stderr: symbolic link to /proc/self/fd/2 Perhaps /dev/std* didn’t exist on the older Android device as it had a really older kernel version. I didn’t have the older device with me, so I tried running a Android VM with Android 8.1 and it didn’t have /dev/std* as well, so definitely it was a Android using older version of the Linux kernel.\nSo, Linux just has /dev/std* as symlinks to /proc/self/fd/*. But those don’t exist on MacOS. Why is MacOS acting weird and not just following the standard. And FreeBSD too didn’t have /proc virtual filesystem. I couldn’t find any information about why this is the case, so I decided to take matters into my own hands and try to read the POSIX manual and figure out if /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout /dev/stderr, and /proc/* are even part of the specification. And they aren’t! Yes, you read that right, /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout and /dev/stderr are mentioned exactly once together and are mentioned as optional non-standard extensions.\nBoth /dev/stdin and /dev/stderr are just mentioned exactly once in the entire POSIX.1-2024 document (the latest as of writing this blog) which defines the standards for any system to be POSIX complaint.\nThe system may provide non-standard extensions. These are features not required by POSIX.1-2024 and may include, but are not limited to: … Additional character special files with special properties (for example, /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout, and /dev/stderr) 2.1.1 Requirements, Page 15\nBut funnily enough there are a total of 14 mentions of /dev/stdout in the document as possible files passed to various POSIX command line utilities. Some of them mentions that passing - or /dev/stdout to the output file would result in the output being written to the stdout. So perhaps, even though the /dev/stdout is an optional non-standard extension, it’s popular enough that the authors decided to mention it in the document.\nSurprise 2: /proc itself may not exist on a POSIX compliant system The POSIX standards do not even specify anything about /proc, even the procfs is mentioned only once in the entire document as a non-standard extension. (See Page 15 of the document 2.1.1 Requirements).\nFreeBSD doesn’t even have procfs enabled by default and you need to mount it yourself. And it’s deprecated\nSurprise 3: /dev/random is also not part of the POSIX specification You might have just read from /dev/random multiple times in bash scripts when trying to gather some entropy or random data. But the POSIX has no mention it in it’s entire specification! In fact the POSIX specification only mentions about /dev/null, /dev/tty and /dev/console. Yes, that’s the entire thing documented under chapter 10 titled “Directory Structure and Devices”.\nConclusion There /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout or /dev/stderr which is guaranteed to work on all POSIX systems. It is very important to note this when writing portable software. Although all these files exist on almost all POSIX system I have used (if you add the old Android phone I mentioned of earlier), it’s not guaranteed to work. The only portable way is to actually just use the file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 for /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout and /dev/stderr respectively. And there exists no portable way to specify a program to write to stdout/stderr instead of a file unless the program supports doing it.\nAlthough a lot of the special files which we are used to in the /dev and /proc are missing from the POSIX standard, I must say that almost all of the C APIs are really well thought and documented really well. The structs for all the data types like addrinfo are really well thought of. The C API documentation also is very extensive. This proves that even after 50+ years of existing, Unix’s design was just really good and well thought that still today we have majority of webservers, and almost all of the supercomputers in the world running either Linux or other Unix-like OS like BSDs. I just find it wild how well thought the entire Unix OS was at that time!\nAlso at times, it’s better to read the documentation/manual/specification instead of relying on internet articles to solve your problems if you don’t want headaches in future.\nCorrections This article may not be completely accurate, although I have tried to ensure that it is.

I just did a quick <code>file /dev/stdin</code> and found that it doesn&rsquo;t exist. Nor did <code>/dev/stdout</code> and <code>/dev/stderr</code> exist. I just used to assume that they do exist on all devices! Then I looked on the internet to find the workaround, and <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/a/24598112>StackOverflow gave me a workaround: to use <code>/proc/self/fd/{fd}</code> where fd is 0, 1 or 2</a>. And it worked.</p><p>Then I fixed the tests and kept the patches with me for around 3 years and forgot about it. And now that I decided to upstream some of the Android build fixes for Node.js which I was keeping with me for a long time so that others may benefit too. I sent the PR and waited for CI to turn green, but it failed. And it turns out that MacOS doesn&rsquo;t have procfs (<code>/proc</code>), but exposes most of those stuff via sysctl as documented over <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20200103161748/http://osxbook.com/book/bonus/ancient/procfs/>https://web.archive.org/web/20200103161748/http://osxbook.com/book/bonus/ancient/procfs/</a>.</p><p>Then I looked over on my Arch Linux system:</p><div class=highlight><div class=chroma><table class=lntable><tr><td class=lntd><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code><span class=lnt id=hl-3-1><a class=lnlinks href=#hl-3-1>1</a>

I didn&rsquo;t have the older device with me, so I tried running a Android VM with Android 8.1 and it didn&rsquo;t have <code>/dev/std*</code> as well, so definitely it was a Android using older version of the Linux kernel.</p><p>So, Linux just has <code>/dev/std*</code> as symlinks to <code>/proc/self/fd/*</code>. But those don&rsquo;t exist on MacOS. Why is MacOS acting weird and not just following the standard. And FreeBSD too didn&rsquo;t have <code>/proc</code> virtual filesystem. I couldn&rsquo;t find any information about why this is the case, so I decided to take matters into my own hands and try to read the POSIX manual and figure out if <code>/dev/stdin</code>, <code>/dev/stdout</code> <code>/dev/stderr</code>, and <code>/proc/*</code> are even part of the specification. And they aren&rsquo;t! Yes, you read that right, <code>/dev/stdin</code>, <code>/dev/stdout</code> and <code>/dev/stderr</code> are mentioned exactly once together and are mentioned as <em>optional</em> <strong>non-standard</strong> extensions.</p><p>Both <code>/dev/stdin</code> and <code>/dev/stderr</code> are just mentioned exactly once in the entire <a href=https://doi.org/10.1109/IEEESTD.2024.10555529>POSIX.1-2024</a> document (the latest as of writing this blog) which defines the standards for any system to be POSIX complaint.</p><blockquote class="alert alert-type-none"><ol start=4><li>The system may provide non-standard extensions.

Some of them mentions that passing <code>-</code> or <code>/dev/stdout</code> to the output file would result in the output being written to the <code>stdout</code>. So perhaps, even though the <code>/dev/stdout</code> is an <em>optional</em> <strong>non-standard</strong> extension, it&rsquo;s popular enough that the authors decided to mention it in the document.</p><h3 id=surprise-2-proc-itself-may-not-exist-on-a-posix-compliant-system>Surprise 2: <code>/proc</code> itself may not exist on a POSIX compliant system<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#surprise-2-proc-itself-may-not-exist-on-a-posix-compliant-system>#</a></h3><p>The POSIX standards do not even specify anything about <code>/proc</code>, even the procfs is mentioned only once in the entire document as a non-standard extension.

But the POSIX has no mention it in it&rsquo;s entire specification! In fact the POSIX specification only mentions about <code>/dev/null</code>, <code>/dev/tty</code> and <code>/dev/console</code>. Yes, that&rsquo;s the entire thing documented under chapter 10 titled &ldquo;Directory Structure and Devices&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#conclusion>#</a></h2><p>There <code>/dev/stdin</code>, <code>/dev/stdout</code> or <code>/dev/stderr</code> which is guaranteed to work on all POSIX systems. It is very important to note this when writing portable software. Although all these files exist on almost all POSIX system I have used (if you add the old Android phone I mentioned of earlier), it&rsquo;s not guaranteed to work. The only portable way is to actually just use the file descriptors <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, and <code>2</code> for <code>/dev/stdin</code>, <code>/dev/stdout</code> and <code>/dev/stderr</code> respectively. And there exists no portable way to specify a program to write to stdout/stderr instead of a file unless the program supports doing it.</p><p>Although a lot of the special files which we are used to in the <code>/dev</code> and <code>/proc</code> are missing from the POSIX standard, I must say that almost all of the C APIs are really well thought and documented really well. The <code>struct</code>s for all the data types like <code>addrinfo</code> are really well thought of. The C API documentation also is very extensive. This proves that even after 50+ years of existing, Unix&rsquo;s design was just really good and well thought that still today we have majority of webservers, and almost all of the supercomputers in the world running either Linux or other Unix-like OS like BSDs. I just find it wild how well thought the entire Unix OS was at that time!</p><p>Also at times, it&rsquo;s better to read the documentation/manual/specification instead of relying on internet articles to solve your problems if you don&rsquo;t want headaches in future.</p><h2 id=corrections>Corrections<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#corrections>#</a></h2><p>This article may not be completely accurate, although I have tried to ensure that it is.
